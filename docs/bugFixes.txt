  Rule: KineticEnergyDiffusionToTotalEnthalpySourceTermBoundary
  Problem/Fix: This rule should not be active for cases with wall functions.
    Added the noWallFunction_BC constraint.

  Rules: ViscousDissipationToTotalEnthalpySourceTermInterior
         ViscousDissipationToTotalEnthalpySourceTermBoundary
  Problem/Fix: Bad expression for viscous dissipation. Now consistent
    with ST's notes for total enthalpy equation.

  Rules: FOU inviscid flux rules.
  Problem/Fix: Not ensuring diagonal dominance by subtracting contiuity
    equation. Not a bug, but a different strategy (as used in UNS3D), which
    is a total loser. Resulting instability of linear solver caused chaos
    in temperature field. Now, using the same strategy as in the structured
    code.

  Rules: Implicit unsteady contribution to main coefficient for all eqs.
  Problem/Fix: When fixing diagonal dominance problem above, forgot to change
    rho{n,it} to rho{n} in the implicit unsteady component. This was causing
    havoc for unsteady compressible flows.
